#summary Building Jaql from Source

= Build =

The build Jaql from the sources, first check-out the project
and from the project's root directory, issue:

  # ant jar

To run the interpreter, please follow these [Running instructions].

= Using a different version of Hadoop =

The default version of Hadoop used by Jaql is 0.18.3. However, Jaql supports
multiple Hadoop versions (and dependent version of HBase). To build Jaql for
another version, use the {{{hadoop.version}}} ant property. For example, to build
for version 0.19.0, you use ant as follows:

  # ant jar -Dhadoop.version="0.19.0"

We currently support Hadoop versions 0.17.1, 0.18.1, 0.18.3, and 0.19.0.

= Eclipse Setup =
The source code is a common Eclipse java project. It can be imported into 
Eclipse. It needs JDK 1.6 to compile. SUN JDK is preferred since hadoop prefers 
SUN JDK. `jaql/.classpath` contains all the Java libraries from multiple 
versions of hadoop and hbase. And `jaql/.project` contains stuff related to 
antlr and JavaCC. Eclipse `Content Assist` does not work with this `.classpath` 
file.  `jaql/eclipse` directory contains `.classpath` file working with a 
specific version of hadoop and `.project` without antlr and JavaCC stuff. These
`.classpath` and `.project` are preferred if you wan to work with only a 
specific version of hadoop and don't want to use antlr and JavaCC plugin.

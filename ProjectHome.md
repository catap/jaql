Jaql is a query language designed for Javascript Object Notation (JSON), a data format that has become popular because of its simplicity and modeling flexibility. Jaql is primarily used to analyze large-scale semi-structured data. Core features include user extensibility and parallelism. In addition to modeling semi-structured data, JSON simplifies extensibility. Hadoop's Map-Reduce is used for parallelism.

You can get started with the JaqlOverview of the current version, and check out the RoadMap of future changes.

**Announcement**: As you may have noticed, development here has been put on hold. The good news is that Jaql is a part of IBM's [BigInsights](http://www-01.ibm.com/software/data/infosphere/biginsights/) product (updated [docs](http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/bigins/v1r1/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.swg.im.infosphere.biginsights.doc%2Fdoc%2Fc0057474.html)) and we are very excited to help solve a very wide range of problems! A free download of [BigInsights](http://www-01.ibm.com/software/data/infosphere/biginsights/) is available where you can try out Jaql (and some new features) along with the many other features in the product. It has been a hectic period for us, but we also want to let you know that we intend to and are working towards reviving Jaql's open source development as well. Please stay tuned and thank you for all of the feedback!

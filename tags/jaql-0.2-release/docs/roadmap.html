<h1 align="center"> Roadmap </h1>

<p/>
The most important next step for Jaql is to open-source the code and find
a home where we can streamline our interaction with the community. Following
this important milestone, there is no shortage of interesting problems left to solve in Jaql,
and we welcome help on it. These include:

<ul>
<li> 
Enable bindings to other programming languages besides Java
so Jaql clients and functions can be written in, say, Python or JavaScript.
<li>
Upgrade the version of Hadoop that Jaql depends on.
<li>
Investigate how Facebook's 
<a href="http://developers.facebook.com/thrift/">Thrift</a> could be leveraged by Jaql.
<li> 
Performance testing and performance improvements.
<li>
Extend the notion of job tracking, load balancing, and restarting to Jaql queries.
<li>
Investigate how schema may be specified for JSON data and how it can be exploited
for storage and query processing.
<li>
Support more recent versions of Hadoop and HBase.
</ul>

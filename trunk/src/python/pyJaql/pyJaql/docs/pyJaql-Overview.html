<h1 align="center">PyJaql Tutorial</h1> 
<p/> 
<h2>1 Introduction </h2>
<p/> 
PyJaql is an effort to enable python programmers work with Jaql, 
it's achieved not through re-implementing Jaql in python, 
but rather through bridging jaql and python by the using of <a href="http://jpype.sourceforge.net/">jpype</a>,
it provides a few simple and clean functions for python programmers to take the advantage of jaql's capability.
This document introduces you how to setup pyJaql environment and few examples for you to start with.

<h2>2 Ubuntu Installer </h2>
<p/> 
This chapter introduces you pyJaql installation and configuration steps.
<h3>2.1 Pyton</h3>
<p/> 
By default, python is installed on ubuntu. If not, please read guide introduced by <a href="http://www.python.org/">python official site</a> to install. 
The recommended version is python 2.6. 
<h3>2.2 jpype</h3>
<p/> 
Download source from sourceforge :http://sourceforge.net/projects/jpype/files/,  the latest version of jpype 0.5.4.1 is recommended.
<ol>
<li>Make sure you have all of the necessary tools for compiling C code installed: </li>
	<pre>sudo apt-get install build-essential</pre> 
<li>Make sure you have python2.6-dev package installed:</li>
 	<pre>sudo apt-get install python2.6-dev</pre>
<li>Extract jpype package and enter into jpype dir, run the following command: </li>
	<pre>sudo python setup.py install</pre>
<li>Put the newly installed jpype into your PYTHONPATH by putting the following into you /etc/environment , or other system wide variable:</li> 
	<pre>PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/usr/local/lib/python2.6/dist-packages</pre>
<li>Check your install by running the following commands:</li> 
<pre>
$ python
[GCC 4.2.3 (Ubuntu 4.2.3-2ubuntu7)] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import jpype
>>>
</pre>
</ol>
If you don't get an ImportError, you're done! 
<h3>Trouble shooting</h3>
<p>If you got a "jni.h not found" error when installing package, this is must due to wrong JDK path. To manually fix this problem, edit <b>setup.py</b>, on line 47, edit self.JAVA_HOME = "YourJavaHome", save and close then try again, should be fine now. </p>

<h3>2.3 pyJaql</h3>
<p/> 
Download pyJaql installer, namely pyJaql-0.1.tar.gz. Extract this package and enter into pyJaql dir, run following command:
<pre>sudo python setup.py install</pre>
Open python command line, and check your install by below command:
<pre>import pyJaql</pre>
If you don't get an ImportError, the installation is done.

<h2>3 Usage</h2>
<h3>3.1 Launch Jaql in different models</h3>
<p/> 
There are two models to run jaql,  one is "local" model, in this situation, 
pyJaql will launch a mini-cluster on your local machine; On the other hand, 
if you want to luanch pyJaql on an existing hadoop cluster, use "hadoop-cluster" model. 
<ul>
<li>Launch Jaql in local model</li>
Unset hadoop related environment variables, eg HADOOP_HOME, HADOOP_CONF_DIR<p/> 
<li>Launch Jaql in hadoop-cluster model</li>
<i>This model requires  a running hadoop cluster environment.</i></br>
Set required environment variables, HADOOP_HOME and HADOOP_CONF_DIR. Make sure HADOOP_HOME points to the right path
<pre>
export HADOOP_HOME= "yourHadoopHome"
export HADOOP_CONF_DIR= "yourHadoopHome/conf"
</pre>
</ul>

<h3>3.2 Jaql's Hello World</h3>
<p/> 
Basically, there are several steps to get started
First, import PyJaql module
<pre>from pyJaql import * </pre>
Second, initialize jaql engine
<pre>jaql=Jaql()</pre>
Third, execute a jaql expression, one can execute any valid jaql expression by using <b>execute()</b>, which will return a python generator.
<pre>it=jaql.execute("jaql expression",{'variable name':'variable value',...})</pre>
Then iterate the result set, and manipulate the return data as you like,  depending on the output of jaql expresion, there are 3 kinds of data type of the iterating result, list, dict or primitive types(str,int,etc),
there are kinds of ways to manipulate these data easily and conveniently.
<pre>
for item in it:
	# manipulate item as a list, dict or primitive type
	# which depends on the return data format
	# possible ways:
	#1. item type is dict: use item["key"] to retrieve specific key value.
	#2. item type is list: use item[index] to retrieve list element
	#3. item type is python primitive type: directly manipulate item
</pre>
A alternative way to execute a jaql expression is, using <b>evaluate()</b>, this function takes exactly same arguments with excecute(),
however, it returns a list holding all the result data in memory. 
<p/> 
Following examples will show you ways to embed pyJaql in your python program.

<h2>Examples</h2>
<ul>
<li>Ex1. write data to Hadoop HDFS</li>
<pre>
	#Write the books collection from data below to hadoop hdfs. 
	hdfswrite="[{publisher: 'Scholastic',author: 'J. K. Rowling',title: 'Deathly Hallows',year: 2007},{publisher: 'Scholastic',author: 'J. K. Rowling',title: 'Chamber of Secrets',year: 1999, reviews: [{rating: 10, user: 'joe', review: 'The best ...'},{rating: 6, user: 'mary', review: 'Average ...'}]}] -> write(hdfs('books'));" 
	try: 
		jaql=Jaql() 
		jaql.execute(hdfswrite) 
	except JAQLRuntimeException,err: 
		print err.msg 
		#handle exception
	except JVMException,err: 
		print err.msg
		#handle exception
 	finally: 
		jaql.close()	 
</pre>

<li>Ex2. Read data from HDFS, use "filter" to filtrate result and use "transform" to format output data.</li>
<pre>
	#Read data from HDFS, use "filter" to filtrate result and use "transform" to format output data.
	try: 
		jaql=Jaql() 
		it=jaql.execute("read(hdfs('books'))->filter $.title=='Chamber of Secrets' and $.year==1999 - > transform {$.title,$.year}" ) 
		for record in it: 
			print record
	except JAQLRuntimeException,err: 
		print err.msg 
		#handle exception
	except JVMException,err: 
		print err.msg 
		#handle exception
	finally: 
		jaql.close() 
</pre>

<li>Ex3. Use extension parameters in jaql statement</li>
<pre>
	#The use of extension parameters. 
	try: 
		jaql=Jaql() 
		it=jaql.execute("read(hdfs('books'))->filter $.title==$title and $.year==$year - > transform {$.title,$.year}" ,{"title":"Chamber of Secrets","year":1999}) 
		for record in it: 
			print record 
	except JAQLRuntimeException,err: 
		print err.msg
		#handle exception
	except JVMException,err: 
		print err.msg
		#handle exception
	finally: 
		jaql.close() 
</pre>
An alternative way is :
<pre>
       #The use of extension parameters. - alt
       # ...
       vars={"title":"Chamber of Secrets","year":1999}
       it=jaql.execute("read(hdfs('books'))->filter $.title==$title and $.year==$year - > transform {$.title,$.year}",vars) 
       # ...
</pre>

<li>Ex4. Retrieve specific field in result set</li>
<pre>
	#Retrieve specific field in result set
	try: 
		jaql=Jaql() 
		it=jaql.execute("read(hdfs('books'))->filter $.title==$title and $.year==$year - > transform {$.title,$.year}" ,{"title":"Chamber of Secrets","year":1999}) 
		for book in it:
			print book["reviews"][0]["review"] 
	except JAQLRuntimeException,err: 
		print err.msg
		#handle exception
	except JVMException,err: 
		print err.msg
		#handle exception
	finally: 
		jaql.close() 
</pre>

<li>Ex5. Run a jaql script from a script file.</li>
Create a script file, named test.jql, with the content below
<pre>
//Books collection data
$books = [ 
    {publisher: 'Scholastic', 
     author: 'J. K. Rowling', 
     title: 'Deathly Hallows', 
     year: 2007}, 

    {publisher: 'Scholastic', 
     author: 'J. K. Rowling', 
     title: 'Chamber of Secrets', 
     year: 1999, 
     reviews: [ 
       {rating: 10, user: 'joe', review: 'The best ...'}, 
       {rating: 6, user: 'mary', review: 'Average ...'}]}, 

    {publisher: 'Scholastic', 
     author: 'J. K. Rowling', 
     title: 'Sorcerers Stone', 
     year: 1998}, 

    {publisher: 'Scholastic', 
     author: 'R. L. Stine', 
     title: 'Monster Blood IV', 
     year: 1997, 
     reviews: [ 
       {rating: 8, user: 'rob', review: 'High on my list...'}, 
       {rating: 2, user: 'mike', review: 'Not worth the paper ...', 
        discussion: 
          [{user: 'ben', text: 'This is too harsh...'}, 
           {user: 'jill', text: 'I agree ...'}]}]}, 

    {publisher: 'Grosset', 
     author: 'Carolyn Keene', 
     title: 'The Secret of Kane', 
     year: 1930} 
  ];
// Write the books collection from data above. 
$books -> write(hdfs($filename)); 
</pre>
Execute it in python program:
<pre>
	#Run a jaql script.
	try: 
		jaql=Jaql() 
		jaql.execute_script("/home/young/test.jql",{"filename":"test.dat"}) 
	except JAQLRuntimeException,err: 
		print err.msg  
	except JVMException,err: 
		print err.msg 
	finally: 
		jaql.close()	
</pre>

<li>Ex6. Use evaluate() to execute a jaql expression </li>
<pre>
	#Retrieve specific field in result set
	try: 
		jaql=Jaql() 
		value=jaql.evaluate ("[{'name':'alex','age':20,'isStudent':true},{'name':'jack','age':23,'isStudent':false}]->filter $.isStudent==$bool and $.name=='alex'->transform $.name;",{"name":"alex","bool":True}) 
		print value[0] # "value" is a list of result
	except JAQLRuntimeException,err: 
		print err.msg
		#handle exception
	except JVMException,err: 
		print err.msg  
		#handle exception
	finally: 
		jaql.close() 
</pre>
The usage of evaluate() is very same with execute(), but different in how to retrieve data from jaql, 
by which means, evaluate() maintain whole result, sometimes a very big block of data, in memory, 
it cost much more space but consuming less time when retrieving data, 
however, one must consider that, when the result set is very big, evaluate() cost a long time, 
sometimes intolerable, to process and return the data. 
In comparison, execute() does not return us all data in one time, 
its strategy is to retrieve specific data only when you iterate the result set. 
They are designed for satisfying different scenarios.
</ul>

<h2>5 Known Limitation</h2>
</p>
After calling <i>jaql.close()</i>, it will shutdown JVM, if you attempt calling <i>Jaql()</i> again a JVMException will be raised. This dues to SUN's JVM (by now is 1.6.0_16) doesn't allow uploading,  though JNI API defines a method to destroy JVM named <i>destroyJVM()</i>, 
it doesn't work.So, pyJaql shares a unique JVM through program's life cycle, there is no problem if you use several times of <i>jaql=Jaql()</i> to get different jaql engine references, because JVM will only be initialized in the first time, but when you invoke <i>jaql.close()</i>, 
it's required that to make sure no one will use JVM again.
